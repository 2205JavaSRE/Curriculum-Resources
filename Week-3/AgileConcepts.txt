Waht is Agile?
	Iterative Approach, where we focus on smaller timelines (sprints) to build 
	smaller features at a time. Benefit of this approach is that we get feedback 
	sooner on any issues or problems that arise. 

	There are frameworks built on top of it, e.g. Scrum or Kanban that emphasis 
	differents aspects.


Scrum?
	Focus is to work together in teams. 

	Sprints: 
		A short, specific interval of time where work is expected to be done in. 
		Sprints can be as short as a week, or up to a month. 

	Sprint planning; 
		Planning the workload and expectations for a sprint!

	Sprint reviews: 
		Review how the last sprint went. 

	(Daily) Standups: 
		To talk about the progress so far, the plan for the day and any blockers
		if there are any. 

	Scrum Master: 
		They manage the scrum system, ensure everyone knows what they're expecting 
		to do. 
		(For P1, to write up morning standup notes for the team) 
		(Every week, the scrum master will get the option to pass along their title)
