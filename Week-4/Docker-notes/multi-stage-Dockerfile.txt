#But I'm planning a Java application, so I'll use a JDK image
FROM openjdk:8-jdk

#Copying over the jar file into the container
ADD Planet-API.jar Planet-API.jar

#Setting up environment variables

#Final command in the dockerfile
CMD ["java","-jar","Planet-API.jar"]

#After we have written out the Dockerfile
#We execute the command "docker build . " in the terminal, and this will build an image!
# We can provide flags, such as -t , to name the image
