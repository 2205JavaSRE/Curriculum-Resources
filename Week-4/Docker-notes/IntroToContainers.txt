Virtual Machines 
	Benefits of Virtual machines are that:
	> Cost savings and increased efficiency 
	> Easy provisioning 
	> Isolation and DevOps.

	Hardware is virtualized. 

Containers: 
	Operating System level virtualization. 
	A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all of its 
		dependencies into an isolated environment. 
	Containers and VMs are similar, VMs virtualize at hardware level and containers 
		virtualize at the OS level. 

	What this means is that the container will piggy back of the host machines OS. 
	What are the benefits of not needing its own OS?
	
	> Lightweight - requireres even less resources than VM
	> Speed and Scalability - Containers take seconds to deploy, compared to VMs that take minutes. 
	> Isolation and DevOps - create lightweight and isolated environments. 

What is a popular container management tool?
	Docker 

What does docker do?
	When you install docker onto your systems it provides tools for managing our containers. 
	We can configure, create and start containers in our system. 
	This thanks to the docker daemon thread (a constantly background process)

	Dockerfile -> Docker Image -> Docker container 

	Dockerfile:
		Lets us create and configure our own custom imagees, where we can specify, 
		the images our images is going to be built off, set up env variables and set
		up commands for the container to execute.

		Commands associated with a Dockerfile 
		How to build a docker image in the terminal from a Dockerfile

	Docker Image:
		Containers are based of images. An images is simply a recipe, a set of instructions
		for the Docker engine to tell it how to execute the container. 
		Images can be built of other images, so we can use prebuilt images from DockerHub

	Docker Container 
		Container managed by container. Isolated environment with all the dependencies 
		and libraries needed.
