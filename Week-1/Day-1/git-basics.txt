Git:

Git is a distributed version control software.
Git allows us to share code between multiple sources and manage it without causing version clashes. 

GitHub or GitLab allow us to host our git repositories online. 

git status: tell you the status of your repository. See if there's any changes and if those changes are set to be staged. 

git add : "add" our changes that we made locally, to be packaged into a new version. 

git commit : versions our repsitory. 

git push : will be adding our changes to our local repostiroy into the remote repository. 

git clone : clone a remote repository onto our local systems

git pull : update our local repostiroy to reflect the changes in the remote repository
