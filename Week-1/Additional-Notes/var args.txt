Variable-length arguments (Var args):

	When you want a method to take a variable amount of arguments you use
	Var-args. This is better than creating a otn of overloaded methods that
	take different arguments.

	Syntax:
		void myMethod(int ... a){
		}
	//The method will accept any amounts of integers into the arguments

	NOTE:
	Very similar to:

		void myMethod2(int[] args){
		}

	//This is a older style of Java code (before JDK 5)
	//Essentially is identical to var args but it var args automates and hides the process.
