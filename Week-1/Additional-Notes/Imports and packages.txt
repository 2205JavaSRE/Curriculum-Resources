Packages 

	Enacpsulates groups of classes, sub packages and interfaces. They're used to:

		1) Preventing naming conflicts. 

		2) Searching/locating and usage of classes, interfaces and annotations easier.

		3) Providing controlled access. (Offers another level of encapsulation)


By importing packages when necessary we have a simple way of managing all the resources 
that we will be utilising for our application. 

import com.example.NotMyClass //allows us to import the class NotMyClass from file directory
			      //com/example

import com.example.* //allows us to import all the classes from file directory com/example
