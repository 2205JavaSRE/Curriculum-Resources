Access Modifiers:

	Access modifiers can be used before a class, method or variable. This specifies what systems can have access outside the class.
	4 access modifiers:
	
	public: 
		The resource is available to anyone and anything.

	private:
		This resource is only available to the class itself.

	protected:
		This resource is only available to other resources within the same package or to classes that extend the class. 

	(Implicit) default:
		This resource is only available to classes within the same package. If you don't specify a access modifer it will automatically
		assume the default access modifier.
