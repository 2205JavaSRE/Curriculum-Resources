Class vs Object:
	
	Class is essentially a blueprint for the instantiation of an object. Typically if you want
	to access the methods and attributes 'within' a class you'll need to instantiate it into 
	an object (unless you use a static keyword)

	Object is an implementation of an class.

	Object is a 'physical' entity, a class is a 'logical' entity. Memory is only allocated 
	to the object. 

	e.g. We can have a class "Human", "Peter" will be an instance of the class "Human" 
	making it an object of type "Human".
