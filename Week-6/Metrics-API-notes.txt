Kubernetes Metrics-API: https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/

The metrics server is used to collect resource metrics from kubelets and expose them 
in Kuberenetes API server - through the Metrics API. 

Metrics API can be access via "kubectl top" for node and pod information 

Advantages: 
> A single deployment that works on most clusters (see Requirements)
> Fast autoscaling, collecting metrics every 15 seconds.
> Resource efficiency, using 1 mili core of CPU and 2 MB of memory for each node in a cluster.
> Scalable support up to 5,000 node clusters.

We can use Helm to to install the mterics server, using the following commands: 

	#To add the repo to helm locally
	$helm repo add metrics-server https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/metrics-server/
	
	#To deploy it to our kubernetes cluster 
	$helm upgrade --install metrics-server metrics-server/metrics-server

	(NOTE: We should only have a single instance of this running, and to make sure it's in 
		the default namespace using "-n default")
	
We can also do it manually: 

kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
