Stack vs Heap 

	Memory in Java can be either stored in the stack or the heap.
	
	Size vs speed:
		Stack has a much smaller capacity than Heap memory.
		Quicker retrieval of memory from stack compared to Heap.

	What is stored in both?
		Stack contains local primitive variables and reference variables to objects.
		The heap contains objecs (and pretty much everything else).
	
	Use cases?
		Stack is used by a thread, memory is only accessible to the thread using it.
			Stack memory is cleared once the thread is finished using it.
		Heap is globally accessible to the system (i.e. all threads) and the memory 
			is not cleared until the application is closed.
