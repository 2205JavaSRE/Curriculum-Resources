What are the features of Java?
	Java is simple: 
		Simple to learn and easy to read. If you're familiar with 
		C or C++, it can be fairly easy to pick up. 

	Java is OOP: 
		Fully OOP, with all the features and all the advatanges (and the disadvantages)

	Java is robust: 
		Java has the garbage collector, which simplifies memory management
		(no pointers)

	Java is secure:
		Due to lack of manual memory management and no accessing out of bounds 
		array means there is less chance of a secrutiy flaw such as stack corruption. 

	Java is platform independent: 
		Write once, run anywhere (WORA). Anything that has a JVM can run java code. 
		Thankfully a lot of things can hold a jvm. 

	Java is open source: 
		Lots of tools and IDEs
		Many frameworks 
		Open source libraries 
		Lots and lots of documentation.
