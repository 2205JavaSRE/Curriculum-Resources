Features of Java:

	Java is simple:
		Simple to learn and easy to read. Removes the complexities from other languages
		like C++/C, e.g. garbage collection and pointers.

	Java is OOP:
		Fully OOP, with all the features and all the advantages

	Java is robust:
		Automatic garbage collection and simple memory management (no pointers)

	Java is secure:
		Due to a lack of manual memory management and no accessing out of bounds array
		means less chances of security flaws occuring, such as stack corruption.

	Java is platform independent:
		Write once, run anywhere (WORA). Anything that has a JVM can run java code, 
		thankfully a lot of things can hold a JVM. 

	Java is open source:
		Lot of tools and IDEs
		Many frameworks 
		Open source libraries 
		Lots and lots of documentation.
