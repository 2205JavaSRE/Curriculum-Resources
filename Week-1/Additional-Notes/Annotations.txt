Annotations

	A tag that represents metadata , attached with class, interface,
	methods or fields. The infromation is used by the compiler and
	the JVM. 

	When we move onto Hibernate and Spring, it can serve as an 
	alternative for XML interfaces.

	Built-In Java Annotations:
	@Override - ensures that a parent class' method is being overriden.
		If we do a spelling mistake, then an exception will be 
		thrown. 
	@SuppressWarnings - suppresses warning from the compiler, such as 
		a deprecated warning.
