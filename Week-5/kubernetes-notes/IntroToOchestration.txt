What is Ochestration tool?
	Container ochestration tool helps us to manage our distributed application. It has features that 
	make managing containers much easier. 

Features: 
	Reconciling the desired state: 
		The ochestrator's goal is to keep a "state". That state can be to deploy 7 instances of an example
		container app. If a container goes down, the ochestrator will try to redeploy it. 
	
		We can take it a step further by asking it to handle other metrics like traffic load of each container
		to be set to 60%. IF containers are getting hit hard, the ochestrator will deploy more. 
	Replicated and Global Services: 
		Replicate services or provide a global service for other services. 
	Service Discovery: 
		Provides a way to keep track of our services and let other services "discover" them.
