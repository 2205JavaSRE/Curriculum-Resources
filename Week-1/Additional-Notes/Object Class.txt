Object Class:

	Every class in Java is derived from the Object class. If a class does not extend any other class, it is directly a child class otherwise 
	it is indirectly a child class. (It can be viewed as the root of inheritance hieracy)

	This results in every class having access to the Object class' methods, here are some of them:

	toString(): provides a string representation of an Object

	hashCode(): generates a unique number which is hash code. JVM saves objects using hashcode because it's more efficient. 

	equals(Object obj): Compares the original object to "obj"

	getClass() : Returns the class of "this" object
	
	finalize(): the block of logic that can be executed before it's removed by the GC.
