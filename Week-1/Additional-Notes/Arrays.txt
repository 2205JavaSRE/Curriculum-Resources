Java Arrays:
	
	An array is a structure that stores variables of same type. 

	Syntax: 
		There are 2 ways to DECLARE an array:
		int myArray[];
		int[] myArray;

		There are 2 ways to DECLARE an array and POPULATE it:

		Version 1: //Directly populating it
			String[] myArray = {"Apple","Banana","Kiwi"};
			
		Version 2: //Create an array with empty values and then assign values
			String[] = myArray;	//declaring an array
			myArray = new String[3]; //Allocating to memory
			myArray[0] = "Apple";
			myArray[1] = "Banana";
			myArray[2] = "Kiwi";

		Creating multidimensional arrays:
		
		int[][] myArray = {{1},{1,2,3,4},{1,2}};
			

	Properties:
		Arrays themselves are objects (direct child of Object class)
		Index starts at 0
		

	Methods assoicated with Array:
	
	Finding the lenght of an array:		myArray.length
	Accessing a value at an index:		myArray[n];
	Looping through an array:	
			for (int i = 0; i< myArray.length;i++){
				System.out.println(myArray[0]);
			}

			//or with an enhanced loop

			for (String i: myArray){
				System.out.println(i);
			}
