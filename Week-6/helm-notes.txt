What is Helm ?
	Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Allows us to define, install and upgrade
	the most complex Kubernetes applications. 
	
	Helm uses charts - a chart is a collection of files that describe a related set
	of Kubetrnetes resources. For example a single chart might be used to deploy 
	something simple, like a pod or an entire web app with deployments, services, volumes, etc.

What is a chart? https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/
	An organized collection of files inside of a directory. The directory name is 
	the name of the chart (without versioning information).
	
	e.g. a directory will contain: 
	Chart.yaml 			# a YAML file containing information about the chart
	LICENSE 			# OPTIONAL: A plain text file contianing the license for the chart
	README.md 			# OPTIONAL: A human-readable README file 
	values.yaml: 		# The default configuration values for htis chart 
	values.schema.json: # A JSON Schema for imposing a structure on the values.yaml file
	chars/ 				# A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends. 
	crds/ 				# Custom Resource Definitions 
	templates/ 			# A directory of templates that, when combined with values, will generate valid Kubernetes manifest files 
	templates/NOTES.txt # OPTIONAL: A plain text file contianing shot usage notes
