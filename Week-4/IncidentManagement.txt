Incident Management : (incidents are disruptions to our systems)
	Process of handling an incident once an alert has been triggerd by our monitoring systems.
	SRE on call is in charge of starting a process if needed: 
	(Not every alert has to trigger it) 
	> Some alerts have playbooks highlighted, on how to handle it. (good candidates for automation)
	> At the SRE's discretion:
		Is less serious: don't start right away, unless no progress is being made in x amount
			of time. 
		Is serious (bleeding out money) : start the process straight away. 
	> On call in a rotation usually 1 out of 6-8 weeks. ("Have the pager")
	> When Incidents do occur, requires a time response 
		"business critical" within 5 minutes 
		"urgent" within 30 minutes 
	> Once the process has been initiated other teams might be requried to participate 
		> e.g. Development team, DevOps team, Testing team, Business team 
	> To omptimize the resolution of the incident, a clear process and chain of command is recommended.
		> 3 roles: 
			> Incident Commander (IC):
				- owns incident: responsible for making desicions regarding the resolution.
				- Might be the SRE on call, it might be another SRE so that SRE on call can 
					continoue to conduct the investigation (as the Ops Lead)
			> Ops Leader (OL):
				- own the investigation 
				- can add more investigators as needed 
				- communication channel:
					i.e. Slack 
					> updates can be posted
					> metrics/monitoring data 
			> Communication Lead (CL): 
				- keep people informed 
					> keep stakeholdes updated while investigators can focus on the problem.
				- start an incident document:
					> shared with the team to be kept up to date
					> maintain the incident codument as updates are given 
					> once the incident is over, the incident document beccomes the foundation for postmortem.

	> roles can be easily transhered when shifts end, thanks to the incdient document    

Post-mortem 
	> Document based on the incident document that describes what happened and how it was resolved 
		- root cause of the incident 
		- how to address the undelying issues 
	> Drafted by the SRE tream involved in the incident 
		- reviewed and published for everyone to read 	
	> Part of continous improvement culture 
		- learning opportunity to prevent similar incidents in the future
		- blame free (constructive criticism) 
	> General template: 
		- date/people involved 
		- executive summary (1 sentence of what happened and the impact)
		- problem summary:
			- technical issue
			- root cause 	
		- action items:
			- link them to a backlog/product backlog to be iterated on 
		- lesson learned: 
			- what went well 
			- what could be improved on 
		- timeline 
			- highlights the steps taken to recovery
	> getting feedback from other sRE practices: 
		- does the system have good monitory?
			- do we need more/ different metrics?
			- SLI, SLO and SLA 
		- does something need to be automated?
