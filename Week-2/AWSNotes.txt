What is a cloud platform?
	An online service that people can store data.
	Place where you can not have to manage your own server. Infrastructure that is a service. 
	We have Google, Oracle and Amazon for us. 
	Any sort of remote computing service. Hardware as a service, Software as service, 
	Storage as a service. 

	An online service that allows you to access infrastructure, products, software over 
	the internet. 


What are the benefits?
	You don't need to own any of the hardware. None of the maintenance either, just pay 
	the company a flat rate. It's more decenetralized, more resilient to hardware failure. 
	
	It's easily scalable. Because we're not investing in the hardware, we can easily "rent"
	the hardware with a click of a button. Takes a LOT of time.
	Accessible anywhere (with internet).


IaaS: Infrastrcture as a service
	We get access to infrastructure that is managed by a cloud platform. 
	In AWS, we get something called an EC2 instance (Elastic Computing 2) 
	
PaaS: Product as a service

SaaS: Software as a service


AMI:
	Amazon Machine Image, this is a template containing the OS and important libraries. 

Key-Pair: 
	Key pair allows us to authenticate ourselves when we ssh/connect to our remote services. 

Security Group:
	We don't necessarily want anyone to be able to connect to our resource. 
	We define inbound and outbound rules:
		inbound rules specify which ports are available to which IP addresses
		outbound rules, which remote services are machine has access to. 

EBS: 
	Elastic Block Storage, persitant data is stored here. Think of this has the "hardrive"
	to our EC2 instance. 

Free tier for AWS:
	We can have one computer running for the whole month for free
	OR we can have 2 computer running for half the month
